Looking at fatal car accidents to see:
  Which car make and models have the most fatal accidents
  What time of the year (seasons)
  Which states
  
Machine Learning to tell a user how likely a fatal crash is based off what kind of car they want to purchase, what state they live in, what time of the year it is

3/21/22 - Use Kaggle data and let Machine learning determine most frequent accidents due to weather, location, time of day, etc.
 - check to see how many records for each year
    - convert start time column to extract the year
    - count unique year values to make sure we aren't getting rid of one year that has most of the records

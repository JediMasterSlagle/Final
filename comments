Need Hypothesis,   Comparing fatal accidents to total accidents based on car make and model as well as weather patterns of the year

are 'luxary cars' safer?   or we can state that they are and graph the results by states and by types of vehicles with most fatal accidents?  and then maybe also compare the amount of brands purchased to accidents with the brand of car.?  Jossh
